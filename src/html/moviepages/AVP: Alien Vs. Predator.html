<h1><a href="/news/2370">DVD Releases for January 23, 2007</a></h1>

<p>
Business is starting to pick up again for DVD releases. It's still not up to the level of the pre-Christmas boom, or even the yearly average, but at least it's not a desolate wasteland either. There were a couple releases that were contenders for DVD Pick of the Week, but in the end I went with <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2006/TFNYR.php">This Film is Not Yet Rated</A> - <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000JGWD64/thenumbers" target="_NewWindow">Buy from Amazon</A>, but since I work in the industry, at least tangentially, my enjoyment of the movie may have been increased somewhat.

<p>
As <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/Christmas.php">Christmas</A> approaches, each week more and more DVDs are being released that theoretically would make perfect gifts. 
But for the DVD Pick of the Week I went with the perfect Re-Gift, <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/people/series/Seinfeld.php">Seinfeld</A> - <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000BBOUF4/thenumbers" target="_NewWindow">Re-Gift Set</A>. 
There are a couple others I would recommend (like the <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1933/0KK33.html">King Kong</A> - <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000AY3KN0/thenumbers" target="_NewWindow">Collector's Edition</A>), but overall it feels like a really slow week.

Every week films get a second chance at success from the home market; or, in some cases, a first chance at success. Here is a list of wide releases, limited releases and a few from the growing TV on DVD section. Speaking of TV on DVD, this week is massive on that front with more than a dozen complete season sets coming out tomorrow. One of these, <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/people/series/MarriedWithChildren.php">Married... With Children</A> - The Complete Third Season - <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006J27WY/thenumbers" target="_NewWindow">Buy from Amazon</A> is my DVD pick of the week, along with <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/MCREK.php">Mean Creek</A> - <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006IUDTY/thenumbers" target="_NewWindow">Buy from Amazon</A>

<br clear="all"><h1><a href="/news/1001">International Box Office Stolen!</a></h1>

For the first time in many weeks there was a real race for top spot on the international charts, also, for the first time in many weeks <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/NCRDB.php">The Incredibles</A> didn't win that race. Boosted by debuts in 22 additional markets, <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/OCEN2.php">Ocean's Twelve</A> took top spot with $28.9 million on 3900 screens in 27 markets for a early total of $35.2 million. Compared to the <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2001/OCEAN.html">original</A> the results are mixed. IN many places it is a lot lower when compared in local currency, but thanks to the Dollar's extended losing streak, it's much higher in American funds. For instance, the film opened in first place in France with 5.7 million Euros, down 16% from its predecessor, however, that's $7.5 million in American funds, a increase of 28%. Other highlights include $5.3 million in Germany, $3.5 million in Spain, $2.2 million in Italy and $1.4 million in both Holland and Switzerland and just shy of $1 million in Sweden. The film remained in first place in Australia despite dropping 50% at the box office to just $1.8 million.

With a nearly 3-1 lead over its nearest competitor, <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/NCRDB.php">The Incredibles</A> took top spot on the International Box Office charts this week with $44.3 million on 4,362 screens in 22 markets for a running tally of $59.1 million. The film opened number one in all twelve markets and in a few of the markets the film debuted in this week it was able to break the record for biggest debut by an <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/Animated.php">animated films</a>. However, in others it fell short to either <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/FNEMO.php">Finding Nemo</A>, (France) or <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/SHRK2.php">Shrek 2</A> (the U.K. and Spain.) Its biggest single market was the U.K., where the brought in $18.1 million, including sneak peaks, which was a <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/BuenaVista.php">Disney</A> record. Other highlights include $9.2 million in France, $5.6 million in Spain, $5.4 million in Italy, and $1.3 million in Belgium. Considering the results so far it should challenge for supremacy among the elite <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/Animated.php">animated films</a> and $400 million to $500 million isn't out of the question.

<A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/BJDI2.php">Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason</A>'s second round of openings was no quite as strong as last week's, but it was still more than enough to keep its first place finish at the international box office. Overall the British <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/Comedy.php">comedy</A> took in $20.6 million on 1,854 screens in 18 markets lifting its tally to $59 million. Out of the new openings, the film was most impressive in Spain with $2.6 million while its best market overall was the U.K. where the film dropped just 29% to $9.3 million. The film is still tracking well ahead of the <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2001/BJDIA.html">original</A> and is becoming one of the monster hits of the fall.

<A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/BJDI2.php">Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason</A> opened in a mere half a dozen international markets over the weekend, but what an opening it was. Despite place on fewer than 1000 screens the film was able to pull in an amazing $26.7 million, the lion's share coming from the U.K. where the film took in $19.1 million on 496 screens, (including $5.9 million from sneak peaks.) That was the best opening for a Working Title film smashing the previous record of $11.1 million for <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/LVACT.php">Love Actually</A>. In each market the film broke the record for Working Title films and more than doubled the <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2001/BJDIA.html">original</A>'s debut. And even with legs that are expected to be much lower, it should be able to break $300 million internationally, although it may have trouble hitting $50 million domestically.

It's a rare feat for a non-Hollywood film to top the international charts, but that's just what the German spoof, Seven Dwarfs, did this week. Playing in just three markets the film took in $10.6 million on under 1,000 screens. In its home market of Germany the film eased just 19% to $9.2 million; the result was not quite as good in Austria where it dropped a respectable 30% to $915,000, but it was in Switzerland where it shined - <I>increasing</I> 4% to $500,000. Overall the film has now made $29.0 million so far but the real test comes with increased competition from holiday fare and the ability to find an audience in non-German speaking markets.

Holidays throughout Europe, and a $1.5 million, first place finish in Russia helped <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/SHRKS.php">Shark Tale</A> remain in top spot for the fourth straight week, although it was a much closer contest this week. Highlights include $4.3 million in the U.K., off just 24% compared to its sophomore weekend, $4.0 million in France, which was <I>up</i> 47% from last weekend for a $15.5 million in 4,300 theatres in 27 markets weekend. Its international running total topped $100 million, the 13th film to do so this year, and now sits at $109.6 million.

Despite a 45% drop in its weekend haul, <A HREF=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/SHRKS.php>Shark Tale</A> was able easily able to earn it third first place finish on the international charts. Still early in its run, the film took home  $16.2 million in 4,368 theatres in 24 markets pushing its total to $80.3 million internationally. Without any openings the film relied on strong holdovers like in the U.K. where it drop 39%, in France it was off 32% and 35% in Germany.

Thanks to mostly unopposed openings several more markets, <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/SHRKS.php">Shark Tale</A> was able to repeat as the international box office champ this week. Not only that, but its $29.6 million more than doubled its international tally prior to the start of the weekend as the film now sits at $56.2 million. The best opening of the weekend, and most likely of its international run, was in the U.K. where the film managed to take in $9.1 million, ($13.6 million if you include last week's previews.) In France the result was strong with $4.2 million but in the face of local competition, it could only manage $3.4 million in Germany.

Although, with a weekly take of only $9.4 million in 28 markets, it has as much to do with the weakness of the competition as it does with the strength of the film itself. The largest chunk of that box office came from France, where the film earned $3.8 million.

<A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/VILLG.php">The Village</a> once again top took spot on the international scene, but by a very narrow margin. Still being plagued by sharp drop-offs, the film earned $11.2 million on 3,500 screens in 34 markets. So far the film has taken it $117 million internationally, higher than its $113 million it earned domestically. Although, it is much lower than <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/people/directors/MNSHY.html">M.

<A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/VILLG.php">The Village</a> again was the weekend champ in the international box office with $15.3 million on nearly 3,500 screens in 31 markets. Highlights for the weekend include and impressive debut in Germany at $5.5 million and a less spectacular $3.1 million in Japan. The film also suffered a 55% drop-off in its second weekend in Australia while it held up much better in Brazil. So far the film has earned $63.2 million internationally and is well on its way to matching its $112 million domestic total.

The weekend on the international scene was very much the same as last weekend, just a little bit slower. <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/VILLG.php">The Village</a> was again the champ, thanks to seven openings in mostly mid-ranged markets. A $2.2 million debut in Australia was the top money earner as the film took in $9 million in 23 markets. It's international total is now $45 million and should be headed to $100 million before it is done.

<br clear="all"><h1><a href="/news/839">Exorcist has a Scary Start</a></h1>

It was a very strange weekend; going in no movie was the obvious choice for number one and most analysts were predicting that most of new films would flop. I went one step further and predicted that all of them would flop. In the end, the new movies did better, on average, while the holdovers held up about as well as expected. This helped avoid a complete collapse at the box office, but it was still down 14.1% from last weekend. However, it was up 17.1% from last year, ending a mini-streak of year-to-year drops. That help 2004 from slipping any further in the year-to-date comparison, which 2004 currently leads 2003 $6.201 billion to $5.935 billion, or 4.48%.

Like last weekend, all three movies opening wide this weekend are receiving less than stellar reviews. But unlike last weekend, there's no built in audiences for most of these movies, so look for a sharp drop at the box office. On the plus side, there should be quite a battle for top spot with five films within striking distance of each other.

It accomplished this feat by taking in $18.8 million on more than 5,300 screens in 34 markets over the weekend.

<P>
There was a huge jump in the box office this weekend as Friday's top ten was almost 42% ahead of last week's pace. Then Saturday came and the dubious quality of the new entrants helped weekend returned to normal. (While Hurricane Charley shut down much of Florida, it would only have a small effect on the overall box office.) Even so, there was still a 21.2% increase from last weekend, but surprisingly an 6.87% decrease from last year.
