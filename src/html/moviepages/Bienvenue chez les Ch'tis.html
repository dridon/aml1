It did open in a number of smaller markets including Poland where it landed in second place with $507,000 on 105 screens over the weekend and $656,000 in total. However, the lion's share of the movie's weekend haul came from France where it was down just 6% to $3.02 million on 708 screens  for a total of $7.01 million after two. While it did shed screens and markets this weekend, the movie isn't done yet.  With openings in Italy this coming weekend, South Korea in May, and Japan in July it will be earning money well into the Summer.

<!--- $10.72 million --->
Three of the top five films on the international box office chart were not American this weekend, but <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2008/HORTN.php">Horton Hears A Who</A> was able to remain in first place. Over the weekend, it earned $10.72 million on 5,617 screens in 51 markets for a total of $90.36 million. The film opened in third place in France with $3.22 million on 708 screens, which was only an average opening. The film is on track to hit $100 million before it opens in Italy, South Korea, and Japan.

<P>
<!--- $13.02 million --->
Despite falling nearly 50%, <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2008/HORTN.php">Horton Hears A Who</A> rose to first place on the international charts with $13.02 million 5,879 screens in 53 markets for a total of $75.65 million. The film had no major, or even mid-level openings this week, but it held very well in Australia to climb into first place with $1.46 million on 363 screens over the weekend for a total of $5.16 million after two. On the other hand, it plummeted in the U.K., down 68% to $1.87 million on 504 screens over the weekend for a total of $10.71 million after two. The film has yet to open in France, Italy, South Korea, and Japan, and should have little trouble reaching $100 million before it is done. This is low compared to its domestic run so far. However, <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/DrSeauss.php">Dr. Seuss</A> is not as popular internationally as he is in North America, so this is expected. In fact, overall the film has done better than expected.

<br clear="all"><h1><a href="/news/3292">International Top Five - B.C. Breaks the Century Mark</a></h1>

<P>
<!--- $26.81 million --->
Not only did <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2008/10KBC.php">10,000 B.C.</A> remain in first place on the international charts, it also climbed above $100 million during its run. The film added $26.81 million over the weekend on 7337 screens in 57 markets for a total of $117.82 million. This includes openings in China where the movie earned second place with $3.58 million on 1,000 screens, including 537 digital ones. This broke records for widest release in China and the widest digital release on the international scene. However, a glut of new releases pushed the film from first to fifth in the U.K. with $2.06 million on 430 screens over the weekend for a total of $7.55 million. Given the film's hefty production budget and its likely P&A budget, it would need to make $300 million worldwide to have a shot at showing a profit before the home market. This is likely out of the question. On the other hand, to show a profit after the home market, it would only need to make $200 million worldwide. This has likely already happened.

<!--- $38.65 million --->
<A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2008/10KBC.php">10,000 B.C.</A> climbed into first place on the international charts with $38.65 million on 6,569 screens in 48 markets for a total of $74.43 million in just two weeks. The film opened in first place in Russia with $3.99 million on 536 screens and in the U.K. with $3.92 million on 431 screens while it also scored first place in South Korea with $3.13 million on 401 screens over the weekend and $3.56 million in total. It wasn't able to top the charts in either France nor Italy, but had to settle for second place with $3.39 million on 562 screens and $2.91 million on 454 screens respectively. As for holdovers, it held on very well in Mexico, down 28% to $2.98 million on 467 screens over the weekend for a total of $9.16 million. It wasn't as strong in Australia where it fell by more than 50% to $1.01 million on 221 screens over the weekend and $3.83 million in total. <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2008/10KBC.php">10,000 B.C.</A> will hit $100 million very shortly, but it cost $105 million to make, which will make profitability troublesome.

In its native market it earned $28.68 million on 840 screens over the weekend for a total of $73.48 million after just two weeks. At this pace it should hit $100 million by this time next weekend, which is an amazing milestone for that market. Add in its two smaller markets and the film made $29.79 million on 905 screens in 3 markets for a total of $75.44 million.

<P>
<!--- $36.58 million --->
The <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/France.php">French</A> film, <A HREF=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2008/0BVCC.php>Bienvenue Chez les Ch'its</A>, opened over the weekend and it performed tres bien, which means very well. ... I think. I may have just said something rude in French. (On a side note, it was one of four such films to chart this weekend, although it was the only one to reach the top five. We will get to the other three on Sunday.) It set records in its native market earning $31.67 million on 793 screens over the weekend for a total of $36.58 million including previews. Overall it pulled in $32.53 million on 838 screens over the weekend for a total of $37.40 million while its per screen average or $38,816 was the best so far this year. For a film that reportedly cost just 11 million Euros to make, which is about $16 million American, this is a fantastic opening. Even if it had a larger than average P&A budget, it is likely that the film has already shown a profit.
