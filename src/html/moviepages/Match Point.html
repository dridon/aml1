There were eighth new releases to chart this week led by <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2005/AFLUX.php">Aeon Flux</A>; however, while the film topped the charts, its $6.08 million in rentals was hardly impressive.

On the other hand, <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000E6ES9O/thenumbers" target="_NewWindow">American Dad - Volume 1</A> is packed, but I never really got into the show. I don't think any of the releases really deserves to by the DVD Pick of the Week, but <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0CRMB.html">Crumb</A> - <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000ELL1RG/thenumbers" target="_NewWindow">Special Edition</A> is the best of the bunch.

<p>
It's the beginning of a new year, January 1st, 2006 (or at least it was when I wrote this). 
The good news is 2005 is finally over. 
The bad news is 2006 again starts with the month of January, which is always a really slow way to start the year. 
This is a real dead month when it comes to new releases, in fact, of the 10 new releases coming out this month, I'm excited about seeing... none. 
(There are a few movies that could be popular among their target demographic, but I'm just not in those groups.) 
But at least there are a few Oscar contenders that opened in limited release last month that are looking to go wide sometime during the month and that is the only real saving grace.

During the past week promotional websites for several movies were launched and some older ones added additional content. We've hit another slow patch for movie websites, which is not unexpected since the most of the new site on this list are for films that open months from now so there's hardly any content, or open during the dead zone that is January. I would say the best of the rest would be <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2005/KKONG.php">King Kong</A> - <A HREF="http://www.kingkongmovie.com/" target="_NewWindow">Official Site</A>, but it is not strong enough to win the Weekly Website Award.

<!--- $6.6 million --->
<A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2005/HSHOE.php">In Her Shoes</A> fell out of the top five this week with $3.95 million on 2,050 screens in 23 markets for a $30.60 million international box office. 
The film held up amazingly well in Spain, dropping just 8% to $810,000 on 290 screens, but it wasn't as fortunate in France where it lost more than half its opening, earning $400,000 on 293 screens, falling out of the top ten in the process. 
It suffered a similar fate during its third weekend in the U.K. where it was down 55% to $736,000 on 268 screens, but the film already has $7.06 million there, which is better than its domestic run if you take into account the relative sizes of the two markets.

In France the film fell 57% to $1.01 million over the weekend and $14.80 million during its four-week run while it had a similar drop-off in Spain where it was down 56% to $475,000 over the weekend and $9.10 million in total. The box office was less kind in Russia, (down 68% to $136,000); Germany, (down 70% to $232,000) and the U.K., (down 83% to $120,000).
