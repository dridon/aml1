<h2>Synopsis</h2><p>After battling a fire-breathing dragon and the evil Lord Farquaad to win the hand of Princess Fiona, Shrek now faces his greatest challenge: the in-laws. Shrek and Princess Fiona return from their honeymoon to find an invitation to visit Fiona's parents, the King and Queen of the Kingdom of Far, Far Away. With Donkey along for the ride, the newlyweds set off. All of the citizens of Far, Far Away turn out to greet their returning Princess, and her parents happily anticipate the homecoming of their daughter and her new Prince. But no one could have prepared them for the sight of their new son-in-law, not to mention how much their little girl had changed. Little did Shrek and Fiona know that their marriage had foiled all of her father's plans for her future--and his own. Now the King must enlist the help of a powerful Fairy Godmother, the handsome Prince Charming and that famed ogre killer 'Puss In Boots' to put right his version of "happily ever after."

<h1><a href="/news/1047">Oscar Nominations Sidestep Box Office Giants</a></h1>

The Oscar Nominations were announced this morning and at first glance it appears that most of the nominations went to films with smaller budgets and box office results.
Box office hits were nearly shut out of the major nominations. 
<a href="/news/1047">More...</a>
<br clear="all"><h1><a href="/news/1029">Twelve Takes Top Spot</a></h1>

The race for first in the international marketplace continued to be close with three films within a couple million of each other. Leading the way was <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/OCEN2.php">Ocean's Twelve</a> with $17.5 million on 5200 screens in 54 markets; the film's international total now sits at $137 million, slightly more than half of what <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2001/OCEAN.html">Ocean's Eleven</a> finished with. The <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/Heist.php">heist</a> film did open well in several markets, which mostly balances out severe drop-offs due to the post-holiday. For instance, the film opened well in South Korea with $2.1 million on 150 screens and debuted in first place in Argentina, ($500,000), Portugal, (with $720,000) and in the Philippines, ($370,000.) 
<a href="/news/1029">More...</a>
<br clear="all"><h1><a href="/news/1009">Local Flicks Compete for International Crown</a></h1>

<A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/OCEN2.php">Ocean's Twelve</A> opening in another two markets, (Mexico and Belgium) helped the <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/Heist.php">heist</A> film finish first on the international charts with $22.6 million on 5,183 screens in 46 markets. The film opened well in Belgium where it easily took first place with $1.2 million on just 75 screens. That's up nearly 40% compared to the the <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2001/OCEAN.html">original</A>, but down nearly 10% in Euros. In Mexico the film could only manage $1.8 million on 550 screens for a rather limp per screen average. However, in most markets the film is not holding up as well as the studio would have liked. For instance, in Germany the film dropped by more than 50%, in France the decline was 44%. The only exception appears to be Italy where holidays and a serious boost to screen count helped the film climb 33% to $2.9 million over the weekend. 
<a href="/news/1009">More...</a>
<br clear="all"><h1><a href="/news/1001">International Box Office Stolen!</a></h1>

For the first time in many weeks there was a real race for top spot on the international charts, also, for the first time in many weeks <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/NCRDB.php">The Incredibles</A> didn't win that race. Boosted by debuts in 22 additional markets, <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/OCEN2.php">Ocean's Twelve</A> took top spot with $28.9 million on 3900 screens in 27 markets for a early total of $35.2 million. Compared to the <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2001/OCEAN.html">original</A> the results are mixed. IN many places it is a lot lower when compared in local currency, but thanks to the Dollar's extended losing streak, it's much higher in American funds. For instance, the film opened in first place in France with 5.7 million Euros, down 16% from its predecessor, however, that's $7.5 million in American funds, a increase of 28%. Other highlights include $5.3 million in Germany, $3.5 million in Spain, $2.2 million in Italy and $1.4 million in both Holland and Switzerland and just shy of $1 million in Sweden. The film remained in first place in Australia despite dropping 50% at the box office to just $1.8 million.

<br clear="all"><h1><a href="/news/987">Sideways is Golden</a></h1>

Golden Globe Nominations were announced on Monday and as with the <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/interactive/newsStory.php?newsID=971">IFP Independent Spirit Awards</A>, <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/SWAYS.php">Sideways</A> lead the pack with 7 nominations. This does not mean it is the favorite in any particular category, but it does help its chances of taking home some hardware on January 16th. 
<a href="/news/987">More...</a>
<br clear="all"><h1><a href="/news/935">Sharks 4 - Dwarves 7</a></h1>

Holidays throughout Europe, and a $1.5 million, first place finish in Russia helped <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/SHRKS.php">Shark Tale</A> remain in top spot for the fourth straight week, although it was a much closer contest this week. Highlights include $4.3 million in the U.K., off just 24% compared to its sophomore weekend, $4.0 million in France, which was <I>up</i> 47% from last weekend for a $15.5 million in 4,300 theatres in 27 markets weekend. Its international running total topped $100 million, the 13th film to do so this year, and now sits at $109.6 million.

<br clear="all"><h1><a href="/news/707">Control Room Reigns over Per Theatre Charts</a></h1>

Three films earned per theatre averages of more than $10,000 this weekend lead by the debut of the documentary <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/0CORO.php">Control Room</A>, which earned an impressive $27,125 in its lone theatre. Close behind in second place was <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/SHRK2.php">Shrek 2</A>'s record setting debut with an unbelievable average of $25,952 in an unprecedented 4,163 theatres. Lastly, <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/COFCG.php">Coffee and Cigarettes</A> managed a second weekend above the $10,000 average mark with $11,558 despite more than tripling its theatre count to 17.

<br clear="all"><h1><a href="/news/704">Panic Mode - Disengaged</a></h1>

Finally, we have something to celebrate this summer. The lone wide release this week, <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/SHRK2.php">Shrek 2</a> had a multi-record breaking opening, and that meant a huge 51% increase in the overall box office from last weekend. And that lead to a huge increase over the same weekend last year, right? Well not quite, the increase was rather minimal at just 3.6%, inline with estimated ticket price increases. However, this weekend last year was the Memorial Day long weekend, so the comparison is not quite fair. Further more, 2004 has again slipped behind 2003 year-to-date, albeit by the narrowest of narrow margins $3.125 billion to $3.119 billion based on Sunday's estimates.

<A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/SHRK2.php">Shrek 2</a> didn't get off to as solid a start as predicted and without any other wide releases this week we could be in trouble. But there may be mitigating circumstances that will help the box office this weekend.

During the past week promotional websites for several movies were launched and some older ones added additional content. Here the list of this week's releases, a couple of new sites and few updates. It was another deceptively slow week as there are lots of site on the list, but none stood out as an award winning site. Many were simple placeholders, others had just minor updates, and the only three flash sites to launch were mostly marked coming soon. I was even tempted to not give out an award or maybe even bring in a <A HREF="http://www.starwars.com/" target="_NewWindow">ringer</a>. But in the end I went with <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/NCRDB.php">The Incredibles</a> - <A HREF="http://www.theincredibles.com/" target="_NewWindow">Official Site</a>.

All of Hollywood is desperate for a big hit. Admissions are down nearly 3% from this time last year and we've yet to have a breakout hit in May. Hoping to change that is <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/SHRK2.php">Shrek 2</a>, which opens tonight in a near record 3737 theatres.

<P>
Both opening films were unable to reach expectations and because of this we saw a relatively flat performance week-to-week of just 6.8%. And compared to last year's monster opening for <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/MTRX2.php">The Matrix Reloaded</A> this year was down an amazing 26.5%. Year to date now has 2004 up by just 1.2%, half the estimated ticket price inflation and unless <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/SHRK2.php">Shrek 2</A> opens huge next weekend this year will dip below last year's pace.

May marks the start of Summer, at least according to the movie industry. And while Memorial Day Weekend is the official start of Summer, the first weekend in May is becoming increasingly important. So it's no surprise that there are 8 movies set for wide released during the upcoming month. ... Wait a minute; that can't be right. With just 8 movies opening each week there will be the potential blockbuster and the counter-programming movie, thereby maximizing profits. Obviously this has to change.
