It's best market continued to be South Korea with $3.167 million, down 38% from last weekend dropping to second place along the way.

It was a slightly busier weekend as several studios were brave enough, or foolhardy enough to try and sandwich their film between the worldwide release of <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2005/STAR3.php">Revenge of the Sith</A> and <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2005/BAT5.php">Batman Begins</A>, which debuts in just 10 days.

In France the film dominated the marketplace with $4.94 million on 450 screens and in Germany the film earned $760,000 in semi-limited release (120 screens) for the best per screen average in the market. On the other hand, the film flopped in Slovakia where it missed the top ten in its debut. On the holdover front, the multi-<A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/interactive/newsStory.php?newsID=1126">Oscar</A> winning front saw its weekend haul climb by 20% in Spain to $980,000 and it's still doing well in Australia, Italy and South Korea.

<br clear="all"><h1><a href="/news/1176">Baby Still Earning Millions</a></h1>

<A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/MDBAB.php">Million Dollar Baby</A> has again slipped off the radar screen, but we do know it hit $52 million internationally, which means it made $9 million during the week. The film didn't earn $1 million in any single market, but is still doing strong in South Korea, ($970,000), Spain, ($840,000), Italy, ($600,000) and Australia, ($350,000.) Best estimate has the film earning just shy of $5 million of that over the weekend and taking sixth place on the international box office charts.

After gathering in all the data the winner for the race for fifth place is <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/MDBAB.php">Million Dollar Baby</A>, I think. It would need to lost more than 40% from last week's total and that's not taking into account its openings in South Korea at $1,515,672 and second place, its $110,000, third place debut in Finland, $86,000 in Russia, $50,000, second place debut in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, exact weekend totals are unknown but it is estimated at $6 million raising its international total to $43 million so far.

<A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/AVIAT.php">The Aviator</A> beat weekend estimates by a substantial margin leading to a $5.9 million box office on 3000 screens in 34 markets. The multi-<A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/interactive/newsStory.php?newsID=1126">Oscar</A> winning movie has hit $86.2 million internationally and will cross $200 million worldwide before too long. The film dropped a spot to fifth place in South Korea with $834,660 for the week and slipped to second in Australia with $798,000. The only market the film opened it was Argentina, where it easily took top spot with $232,000.

No new openings means the <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/Heist.php">heist</A> film had to rely on holdovers likes its $2.5 million during its third weekend in the U.K. and $1.4 million during its fifth week of release in Japan, finishing second in both those markets.

<br clear="all"><h1><a href="/news/1112">Massive Turnout for Presidents\' Weekend</a></h1>

<P>
The long weekend helped boost ticket sales to higher than expected levels, with almost every film meeting or exceeding predictions. 
Percentage-wise, the three-day weekend was up 10.9% from last weekend and more than 40% from last year. 
However, this weekend last year was not Presidents' Day Weekend and thus that comparison is misleading. 
Comparing 2005 Presidents Day Weekend to 2004 and the results are still very strong, just not overwhelmingly so; 3-day 2005 was up 7.0% and 8.4% for the 4-day weekend. 
Year to date, 2005 is up 13.4% on 2004, with $1.121 billion. However, 2004 had a slow start and didn't really take off until late February.

Iznogoud: Calife a la place du calife, a movie based on a Asterix and Obelix <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/SpinOff.php">spin off</A> of sorts, dominated the French box office taking in $7.1 million, more than double the second place film and more than a third of the top ten total. It is also enough to push it into the <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/interactive/newsStory.php?newsID=1101">Top Five</A> on the international scene, dropping <A HREF="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2004/NVRLN.php">Finding Neverland</A> into sixth place.

Just one look at February and it feels like it's a worse month than January was. Maybe it's the fact that January was stronger than expected so February's releases look weaker by comparison. Or maybe it's the lack of a massive hit like we had last year. Regardless of the reason, there's little to be enthusiastic about this month.
